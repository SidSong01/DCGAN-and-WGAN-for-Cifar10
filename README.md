# Overview

Using the car pictures in cifar10 dataset to build DCGAN and WGAN for generating car pictures.

## Requirement

* tensorflow 1.15
* python 3.6 
* cifar10 dataset
* unzip the cifar10 dataset(get the "cifar-10-batches-py" folder), put it in the same folder with the .py/.ipynb files. 

## How to use

1. Get all the necessary enviroment and data
2. mkdir dcgan_img, mkdir wgan_img

3. `$ python dataSet.py`

For `dataSet.py`, it is for getting the training data, save as TFRecords.

you can change the class # in `dataSet.py` to get different data from cifar10 dataset.

4. if you want the DCGAN model

`$ python dcgan.py`

But I recommend rewrite it in JupyterHub for better debugging and displaying.

5. If you want the WGAN model

`$ python wgan.py`

But I recommend rewrite it in JupyterHub for better debugging and displaying.

### The DCGAN model will be saved in the folder `ckpt`, you will see the last five saved models. The GenLog.log and loss of it will be saved in the folder `trainLog`.

### The WGAN model will be saved in the folder `Wgan_ckpt`, you will see the last five saved models. The GenLog.log and loss of it will be saved in the folder `Wgan_trainLog`.

### The output images will be saved in folder `dcgan_img` and `wgan_img`

# WGAN model.

`WGAN.py`

* Total data number 	5000

* Batch size	64

* Noise size	128

* Iterations	35000

* Learning rate	0.00005



# DCGAN model.

`DCGAN.py`

* Total data number 	5000

* Batch size	64

* Noise size	128

* Iterations	12000

* Learning rate	0.0002

 `TFR` foder is the training data.

`best_10_images_for_all` is the foder of the best 10 images generated either by WGAN or DCGAN.

`dcgan_best_pic` and `wgan_best_pic` are the foders for seperate the images for DCGAN and WGAN. There are 10 images for each model.
